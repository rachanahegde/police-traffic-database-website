# Police Traffic Database Website
## Description
A system for police officers to record and retrieve information about vehicles, people and traffic incidents. Officers can search the database via the web interface in order to view and update records. Officers can also submit new records for vehicles, people, reports and assign vehicles to owners.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and SQL for the COMP 4039 Module (MSc Computer Science).
